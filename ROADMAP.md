# Roadmap

What needs to happen for **XTL 1.0** (spec) and **xl3 1.0** (reference
implementation).

The current version is **1.0.0-rc.1** (npm) targeting **XTL 0.1 (draft)**.
Breaking changes are still possible during 0.x. The 1.0 cut is gated on
technical stability and the time-bound soak below. Ecosystem adoption is
tracked separately and does not block the compatibility promise (ADR-0079).

## What 1.0 means for xl3

The 1.0 target is one stable end-to-end promise:

> **application-owned JavaScript data → Excel template → generated `.xlsx`.**

An application may pass an already-parsed `xl3-source-json/0.1` object to
`convertJson`; no source data file is required. xl3 applies the data to the
operator-authored workbook and returns `OutputFile[]`, with each completed
workbook in `OutputFile.data` as a `Uint8Array`. The same API runs in Node
and browsers.

That narrow workflow still carries **operator-readable trust**: a spec that
doesn't shift, a reference impl that doesn't surprise, and a surface small
enough that an operator can review a template without reading code. It is
**not** about feature completeness vs JXLS — xl3 intentionally ships a
smaller surface (ADR-0043 + ADR-0048). Database/API/ORM access belongs to the
host, and dynamic images, custom host-language commands, streaming, macros,
and pivot/chart authoring do not block 1.0. The intended audience is **Korean
operations teams that manage many customer-specific invoice formats**
(거래명세서, 정산서, 발주서); the engine generalizes beyond this niche, but
the niche is the wedge.

## 1.0 blocking gate table (single source of truth)

Each blocking gate has an owner, the artifact that closes it, the pass-fail
criterion, a fallback if the gate is unreachable, and the target
milestone. Per-version step plan below references these gates by ID.

| ID | Gate | Owner | Artifact | Pass criterion | Fallback | Status (audited 2026-08-30) | Planned |
|----|------|-------|----------|----------------|----------|--------|---------|
| G1 | Conformance corpus ≥ 140 | maintainer | `conformance/fixtures/` | `ls conformance/fixtures/ \| wc -l` ≥ 140 | — | ✅ **DONE** — corpus is well past the ≥ 140 threshold; the live count is in [`conformance/DASHBOARD.md`](./conformance/DASHBOARD.md), which is generated | DONE (160 fixtures; ADR-0066 added 141-145 mid-0.7.x; ADRs 0067-0069 added 146-155 in 0.8.0; 156 (#49 native value preservation) + 157 (#51 grouped side cells) added post-0.8.1; 158 (#52 arithmetic associativity) in 0.9.0; 159-161 (ADR-0073/0074 subtotal errors) in 0.10.0; 162-169 (data-loss group, spec-derived) + 170 (numFmt across @repeat expansion, Stage 2) added 2026-07-28 for G24; number 098 is unused, so at that point the count was 169 against a highest index of 170; ADRs 0051-0065 reserved further numbers for 0.7.1) |
| G2 | Stage 2 OOXML canonicalization spec'd | maintainer | ADR-0006 + canonicalizer in src/ | covered by fixtures 024-027, 093 + ADR-0006 amendment | — | ✅ **DONE** | DONE |
| G3 | Error code catalog frozen | maintainer | `impl/js/src/__tests__/error-codes.test.ts` snapshot | no breaking catalog change for 30 days (additions allowed, logged — see "Frozen vs unchanged") | — | ✅ **DONE** — held through 0.11.0 under the amended criterion. `cabe0e1` added `xl3/source-json/invalid` (62→65 codes since `v0.9.0`); additive, so the gate stands. Last breaking catalog change: none since the gate ticked 2026-06-23 | ✅ ticked 2026-06-23 (last catalog change 2026-05-24 `a8f7ad3` +3 codes `xl3/block/overlap`·`xl3/block/empty-table`·`xl3/directive/orphan`; `89bee51` added `xl3/expression/bracket-outside-block` 2026-05-23; 30-day freeze elapsed — post-05-24 commits touched the file with comments/JSDoc only, `EXPECTED_CODES` unchanged) |
| G4 | JXLS boundary published | maintainer | ADR-0048 | file exists, references PORTERS_GUIDE | — | ✅ **DONE** | DONE |
| G5 | Deferred-impl ADRs landed | maintainer | ADR-0038 impl ✅ (2026-05-18) + ADR-0040 PE impl | ADR-0038 portion shipped (fixtures 132-135); ADR-0040 CF/DV + outline level both landed | — | ✅ **DONE** 2026-08-16 — the pure rule module (`impl/js/src/range-extension.ts`, 30 unit cases) is now wired in as the post-expansion sweep ADR-0040 calls for (`extendRangesForExpansion`), on both the plain and grouped `@repeat` paths, and pinned by Stage 2 fixture `171-cf-dv-range-extension`. Writing the fixture for the *other* half — recorded as shipped in 0.6.0 but never covered, because the ADR cited a fixture number that went to an unrelated fixture — exposed a real defect: expanded rows never received the template row's `outlineLevel`, so they kept splice residue. Fixed in the expansion write loops and pinned by `172-outline-level-preservation`. Both fixtures fail if the code is reverted | 0.6 (partial) / **closed 2026-08-16** |
| G6 | Public API surface frozen | maintainer | `impl/js/src/__tests__/api-surface.test.ts` snapshot | no breaking surface change for 30 days (additions allowed, logged — see "Frozen vs unchanged") | — | ✅ **DONE** — held through 0.13.0 under the amended criterion. `cabe0e1` added `convertJson`/`previewJson` (0.11.0) and `30742f3` added `VERSION`/`getEngineInfo` (0.13.0, #103), taking the snapshot 13 → 15 → 17; both additive, so the gate stands. Last breaking surface change: none since the gate ticked 2026-06-17 | ✅ ticked 2026-06-17 (snapshot unchanged since 2026-05-18 `16f0608`) |
| G7 | JSDoc examples on @stable exports | maintainer | TypeDoc output | every `@stable` symbol has `@example` block | — | ✅ **DONE** — re-verified 15/15 `@stable` declarations carry `@example` | ✅ DONE 2026-06-21 — 13/13 `@stable` callables carried `@example` (PR #59); re-verified at **15/15** after 0.11.0 added `convertJson` / `previewJson` (`previewJson` shipped without one and was fixed 2026-07-27) |
| G8 | Performance characterized | maintainer | `scripts/BENCH.md` | 1k/10k/100k row × 5/10/20 col matrix + memory-ceiling + parse/eval/write split published | — | ✅ **DONE** 2026-07-28 — `npm run bench:matrix` sweeps 1k/10k/100k × 5/10/20 (9 cells, all completing), with a parse/eval/write split and per-cell peak RSS. Published in `scripts/BENCH.md`. Headline: write is 61–82% of wall clock, parse is data-independent (~3 ms), and memory is the binding constraint at ~2.2 KB/cell (2M cells → 4.2 GB) | 0.7.1 |
| G9 | Perf regression guards | maintainer | `impl/js/src/__tests__/perf-regression.test.ts` | ≥ 2 large scenarios with a ratio-based assertion, running in CI | — | ✅ **DONE** 2026-07-28 — row scaling and `@join` scaling, each asserting 10× the rows costs < 20× the time. Observed 6.2× and 6.9×; a quadratic regression lands near 100× | 0.7.1 |
| G10 | Cross-browser smoke | maintainer | `ci.yml` | Safari + Firefox bundle-load + 1 convert() per run | — | ✅ **DONE** 2026-07-28 — `cross-browser` job runs `npm run browser:smoke`, which loads the IIFE bundle in Playwright `webkit` (the engine Safari is built on) and `firefox`, checks all 19 runtime exports from the shared manifest, and runs one `convert()` per engine against fixture 001. Not Safari-the-application: engine coverage only | 0.7.1 |
| G11 | Stage 2 in CI | maintainer | `ci.yml` | `npm run conformance:stage2` runs on every PR | — | ✅ **DONE** — runs at `ci.yml:35` | 0.7.1 |
| G12 | Undecided behavior pinned (pivot/sparkline/ListObject/page break) | maintainer | conformance fixtures + ADR per item | each: fixture pinning current behavior OR ADR explicitly deferring to 1.x | defer to 1.1 with ADR | ✅ **DONE** 2026-07-28 — ADR-0076 takes the deferral arm for all four, amending ADR-0036 with rows 10-13 and recording measured reference-impl behavior as non-normative. No fixture: pinning a behavior the ADR declines to assert would have to be deleted in 1.1. Also resolves ADR-0046 § 5, which pointed at an ADR-0036 row that was never written | 0.7.1 / 0.8 |
| G16 | Maintainer set widening | maintainer | `GOVERNANCE.md` | ≥ 2 people with accept/reject rights for ADRs and impl PRs | explicit accept of single-maintainer 1.0 governance shape via amendment to GOVERNANCE | ✅ **DONE (via fallback)** 2026-07-28 — ADR-0077 explicitly accepts a single-maintainer 1.0 and `GOVERNANCE.md` states it. The primary criterion (≥ 2 accepters) is **not** met; the fallback is. ADR-0077 records what that does and does not mitigate, and names the triggers to revisit | 0.8 |
| G17 | Korean cookbook i18n complete | maintainer | `website/i18n/ko/.../guides/` | all cookbook recipes have Korean translation | — | ✅ **DONE** 2026-07-28 — guide 19 translated for ko / ja / zh-CN. All 19 guides + index now exist in all three locales | DONE — recipes 01-18 in 0.6; guide 19 and all locale indexes completed 2026-07-28 |
| G19 | Migration guide 0.x → 1.0 | maintainer | `docs/migration-0.x-to-1.0.md` | documents every behavior change or confirms additive-only | downgrade to CHANGELOG note if confirmed additive-only | ✅ **DONE** 2026-07-28 — `docs/migration-0.x-to-1.0.md` written. The CHANGELOG fallback did **not** apply: 0.x was not additive-only. 17 behavior changes across 0.2/0.3/0.6/0.7/0.10 are documented, split by whether they raise or silently alter output | 0.8 |
| G20 | SECURITY.md + threat model | maintainer | `SECURITY.md` + spec amendment | docs zip-bomb / oversized workbook / formula-execution stance + limits API | — | ✅ **DONE** — SECURITY.md covers zip bomb, large workbook, formula stance, and points at the limits table | 0.7.1 |
| G21 | Hard limits documented (no streaming until 1.1) | maintainer | spec/evaluation.md | row / memory hard limit values + AbortSignal API documented | — | ✅ **DONE** 2026-07-28 — `AbortSignal` shipped (`ConvertOptions.signal` on all four entry points, `xl3/abort/cancelled` catalogued, no partial output). Limits now measured rather than drafted: `spec/evaluation.md` publishes ~2.2 KB/cell memory and a verified ~2M-cell ceiling from the G8 matrix. The unmeasured 1M-row soft cap was withdrawn — it needs ~10 GB and was never reachable | 0.7.1 |
| G22 | API surface — internal model types separated | maintainer | `impl/js/src/index.ts` exports + STABILITY.md | only `convert`/`preview`/`analyze` + stable interfaces marked `@stable`; model/parser types marked `@experimental` or moved to `xl3/internal` | — | ✅ **DONE** | DONE (0.6) |
| G23 | RC soak | maintainer | git tags | RC published; ≥ 21-day soak (extended from 7 day per review feedback); 0 critical issues | — | ✅ **DONE** — ticked 2026-06-16 | ✅ ticked 2026-06-16 (21-day soak from rc.1 2026-05-26; 0 critical — soak-period fixes #49–52 folded into 0.9.0, none reset the clock per the G23 breaking-change definition) |
| G24 | Technical stability window | maintainer | release calendar | 90 days after the later of the final blocking gate closing or the last breaking spec/API/error-code change; all release gates green and no known critical data-loss/security issue at cut | breaking change → restart clock; critical issue → block cut | ⏳ **IN PROGRESS** — all blocking prerequisites are complete. G5 closed on 2026-08-16; the pre-RC audit then corrected the public `OutputFile.data` declaration from `ArrayBuffer` to the `Uint8Array` value the runtime had always returned. The conservative breaking-signature rule therefore starts the final window on 2026-08-30. The `data-loss` group is complete (9 fixtures, 162-170, tagged `data-loss`) and covers all 4 required paths — silent-stringify, date round-trip, formula-result kind, and numFmt drop | window **2026-08-30 → 2026-11-28** if no further breaking spec/API/error-code change; adoption-track progress does not affect it |

## 1.x adoption track (non-blocking for 1.0)

These metrics remain public project-health commitments, but they do not block
the 1.0 compatibility promise. Their IDs are retained for stable references.
See ADR-0079 for the separation of technical readiness from ecosystem growth.

| ID | Adoption outcome | Owner | Artifact | Success criterion | Status |
|----|------------------|-------|----------|-------------------|--------|
| G13 | Second-language impl validation | external (xl3-py) | `conformance/reports/*.json` | xl3-py passes ≥ 80% Stage 1 OR ≥ 80% Stage 2, or another Rust/Go/Java implementation reaches a documented 50% | 🟡 **NOT JUDGEABLE** — the last xl3-py report passed 133/133 fixtures it ran, but it is not current enough to establish a percentage of today's corpus; needs a fresh report |
| G14 | External-contributor ADR | external | `spec/decisions/NNNN-*.md` | ≥ 1 ADR with non-maintainer as Author (≥ 60% of Context/Decision sections by line count) | ❌ **OPEN** — no qualifying ADR yet |
| G15 | Production reference case | external (with maintainer help) | `IMPLEMENTATIONS.md` "Production users" row | ≥ 1 named user with permission to list, including a public case study from the maintainer's employer | ❌ **OPEN** — no public named production user yet |
| G18 | Production use case in README | maintainer | `README.md` | publish a concrete production reference after G15 | ❌ **OPEN** — follows G15; it does not control the 1.0 status label |

### Definitions (testable)

- **Adoption track (G13, G14, G15, G18):** public, testable project-health
  metrics that continue through 1.x but do not start, stop, or reset G24.
- **External contributor (G14):** not in `GOVERNANCE.md` maintainer set
  AND not in `Co-authored-by` history of merged ADR commits at PR open
  time. Drive-by typo edits do not count; named Author in ADR
  front-matter; authored ≥ 60% of Context/Decision sections by line
  count.
- **Breaking change (G24, G23):** (a) removal, rename, or signature
  change of an existing export in the public API surface snapshot,
  (b) error code catalog rename / removal / repurpose, (c) ADR
  `accepted` → `rejected` or contradicting status flip. Patch releases
  and additive ADRs do NOT reset the quarter clock.

  *Amended 2026-07-28.* (a) previously read "any change to public API
  surface snapshot", which made it asymmetric with (b) — an added error
  code was additive but an added export was breaking. Read literally
  that made 0.11.0's `convertJson` / `previewJson` a clock reset, which
  contradicts the 0.11.0 note below. Both clauses are now scoped to
  changes that can break a caller. Additions remain **append-only** per
  ADR-0015 and MUST be recorded in `spec/STABILITY.md`.
- **Frozen vs unchanged (G3, G6):** these gates guarantee the surface
  does not *churn* before 1.0, not that it stops growing. Their pass
  criterion is 30 days with no **breaking** change as defined above.
  Adding an export or an error code does not un-tick them; removing,
  renaming, or re-signing one does, and restarts both the 30-day
  window and — via G24 — the quarter clock.

  Rationale for scoping it this way rather than literal "unchanged":
  under a literal reading, any additive fix delays 1.0 by up to 30 + 90
  days, so fixing a real defect is penalised. G21 is exactly that case —
  closing it requires *adding* `xl3/abort/cancelled`. A rule that
  punishes that pushes work toward not fixing it. Scoping to breaking
  changes keeps the criterion doing real work (a removal still resets
  everything) without creating that incentive.
- **Critical bug fix (G23 RC exception):** (a) silent data loss in
  `convert()`, (b) error code catalog inconsistency between docs and
  runtime, OR (c) an `accepted` ADR's MUST that cannot be implemented
  as written. Maintainer cites which of (a)/(b)/(c) in the PR.
- **Perf guards (G9), why not in the corpus:** the gate originally named
  `conformance/fixtures/` and "≥ 2 large fixtures". Both halves conflict
  with the corpus itself. `AUTHORING.md` makes "fixture file sizes should
  be tiny" a hard rule, and the corpus is the cross-implementation
  contract every port must pass to claim conformance — a Python impl being
  slower than the JS one is not an XTL conformance failure. Amended
  2026-07-28 to live as a CI test beside the reference impl, with data
  generated at run time so nothing large is committed. The ratio-based
  requirement is unchanged and is the part that mattered: an absolute
  budget encodes the machine it was written on, a ratio survives a
  hardware change.
- **Data-loss test (G24 testable form):** corpus has a dedicated
  `data-loss` fixture group (≥ 8 fixtures) exercising silent-
  stringify, numFmt drop, formula rewrite, and date round-trip paths;
  all pass on the reference impl.

  *Satisfied 2026-07-28* by fixtures 162-170. "Group" is the `data-loss`
  **tag**, not a subdirectory: `conformance/fixtures/` is flat and the
  runner treats every directory in it as a fixture, so a nested
  `data-loss/` folder would be read as a fixture with no `meta.yaml`. The
  dashboard already groups by tag. The numFmt-drop path cannot be pinned
  at Stage 1, which compares values and not formats, so 170 declares
  `comparison_stage: 2`.
- **Technical stability window (G24 vs G23):** the 90-day window starts on
  the later of the final **blocking** technical/process gate closing or the
  last breaking change. Adoption-track metrics are excluded. If a breaking
  change happens during RC soak, both the soak (G23) and G24 reset. Under
  ADR-0079 the final implementation gate closed on 2026-08-16; the subsequent
  `OutputFile.data` signature correction moves the current start to
  2026-08-30.

## Per-version step plan

Gate-based, not date-based. Calendar estimates have been removed —
each milestone closes when its listed gates close.

### 0.6.0 — Deferred-impl, narrow scope

Theme: close the highest-impact deferred-impl gate cleanly.

Gates closed: **G5** (`@group`/`@subtotal` impl only — the rest of
ADR-0040 PE moves to 0.6.1), **G17** (Korean cookbook 16/17 missing
translations), **G22** (API surface cleanup before @group exposes
new internal types).

The previous "single 0.6.0 with everything" plan was scoped too
ambitiously per the engineering-feasibility review. ADR-0038 impl
alone is a full pipeline insertion (new directive, group-boundary
state machine, transform-pass partition, renderer rewrite,
group-scoped aggregate eval). Splitting 0.6.0 keeps the milestone
shippable.

### 0.6.1 — Rest of deferred-impl (planned, not yet shipped)

Gates closed: **G5** completion (ADR-0040 PE: CF/DV `sqref`
extension), pivot/page-break behavior fixtures toward **G12**.

Status as of 0.7.0 shipping: this milestone was bypassed by the
spec-audit batch (0.7.0). G5/G12 work folded into 0.7.1.

### 0.7.0 — Spec-audit batch (shipped 2026-05-22)

Theme: close 17 syntactic-conflict gaps surfaced by a deep audit
of the lexer, cell classification, directive composition,
aggregate args, and reserved-sheet semantics. Unplanned in the
original gate table; the perf/CI/limits work originally tagged
0.7.0 moves to **0.7.1**.

Shipped artifacts:

- 15 new ADRs (0051–0065) + amendments to ADR-0021 (group-order
  catalog entry) and ADR-0041 (header-cell multi-line
  normalization).
- 4 new error codes — `xl3/parser/unbalanced-literal`,
  `xl3/lists/invalid-use`, `xl3/eval/bad-aggregate-arg`,
  `xl3/expression/unknown-name`.
- Grammar additions: `positive_integer`, `group_directive`,
  `subtotal_directive`, `aggregate_call`, lexical-disambiguation
  note.
- `src/directive-parser.ts` strictness for leading-zero integers.
- Two-pass parallel review (claude-general + codex); all
  CRITICAL/HIGH findings closed before tag.

Gate impact:

- **G1** — 139 fixtures today. The 0.7.0 ADRs reserved fixture
  numbers **141–187**; impl is pending. G1 closes when those
  fixtures land in 0.7.1.
- **G3** — 30-day error-code-catalog clock **reset** on 2026-05-22
  by the 4 new codes.
- **G6** — no public API surface change; G6 clock unaffected.

### 0.7.1 — Performance + external validation begins (relabeled from old 0.7.0)

Gates closed: **G5** completion (ADR-0040 CF/DV `sqref` range),
**G8** (perf benchmarks), **G9** (perf regression fixtures),
**G10** (cross-browser), **G11** (Stage 2 in CI), **G20**
(SECURITY.md draft + threat model), **G21** (hard limits +
AbortSignal docs).

Also closes the **G1 ≥ 140 fixtures** floor by landing fixtures
141–187 reserved by the 0.7.0 ADRs.

Progress toward: **G12** (undecided behavior pinning), **G13**
(xl3-py).

Relabel: `alpha` → `beta` after G8 publishes and xl3-py reaches
≥ 50% Stage 1.

### 0.8.0 — Data-block design overhaul (shipped 2026-05-23)

Theme: unplanned in the original gate table. A late-0.7.x audit of
data-block expansion surfaced two structural bugs (#46 duplicate
shared-formula owners, #47 stale references in displaced side
cells) that needed a column-scoped rewrite before further
feature work. The original "0.8.0 = sociological gates" plan
moved to **0.8.x patches**.

Shipped artifacts:

- **ADR-0066** — data block is now column-scoped: bounding box of
  `{{...}}` markers extended through contiguous non-empty cells.
  Cells outside that range keep their row positions when the block
  expands. Closes #46 / #47 by construction.
- **ADR-0067** — explicit `@block` directive in three forms (bare,
  `A:D` column range, `A2:D7` rectangle).
- **ADR-0068** — strict multi-block detection on opt-in sheets:
  every `[Column]` marker must sit inside some block; block
  rectangles cannot overlap.
- **ADR-0069** — per-block directive scoping by proximity:
  `@filter`/`@sort`/`@top`/`@source`/`@join`/`@group`/`@repeat`
  attach to the closest data block whose column range overlaps the
  directive's column.
- 4 new error codes: `xl3/expression/bracket-outside-block`,
  `xl3/block/overlap`, `xl3/block/empty-table`,
  `xl3/directive/orphan`.
- Conformance fixtures 146-155 (multi-block, side-by-side blocks
  with different sources, vertically stacked blocks, per-block
  filter, per-block `ROW()` scoping, the three new error paths).

Gate impact:

- **G1** — corpus 139 → 154 fixtures. Floor cleared again.
- **G3** — 30-day error-code-catalog clock **reset 2026-05-23** by
  the 4 new codes. Earliest tick: 2026-06-22, contingent on no
  further code additions/renames during 0.8.x patches.

### 0.8.x — Sociological gates (in flight)

Gates closed: **G14** (external ADR), **G15** (production case;
in progress via maintainer's-employer deployment), **G16**
(maintainer widening or explicit single-maintainer acceptance),
**G19** (migration guide), **G20** completion.

The plan is to ship 0.8.x patches during the recruitment period
rather than wait silently. **G3 quarter discipline:** while
sociological gates run, error code additions and renames are
deferred — any addition resets the G3 clock and pushes the 0.9-rc
target. Only critical-bug-fix codes (per the definition in this
file) may be added during the 0.8.x window.

### 0.9.0-rc.x — Pre-1.0 freeze

Gates closed: **G3**, **G6**, **G7**, **G23** (≥ 21-day RC soak).

This milestone originally treated G23/G3 as the start of G24. ADR-0079
supersedes that calculation: G24 starts only after the final blocking
technical/process gate has closed.

### 0.9.0 — Final freeze cut (2026-06-23)

All four pre-1.0 freeze gates ticked: **G3** (2026-06-23 — last
catalog change 2026-05-24 + 30 days), **G6** (2026-06-17), **G7**
(2026-06-21, PR #59), **G23** (2026-06-16 — 21-day soak, 0 critical).
RC-soak fixes #49–52 folded in; #54/#56/#57 deferred to the
`post-1.0` milestone (POST-1.0 additive — the milestone was titled
"0.10.0" at this cut; renamed 2026-07-27 once 0.10.0 and 0.11.0 both
shipped without these items, and #57 was closed as superseded by the
host-driven `__inputs__` source metadata in #82). At this cut, G24 was
calculated from 2026-06-23 via G3 (confirmed by the 2026-07-28 audit, #86).
ADR-0079 later superseded that calculation and rebased the window to
2026-08-16, when G5 became the final blocking implementation gate to close.

### 0.10.0 — Org move + `@subtotal` correctness (shipped 2026-07-19)

Repository transferred to the **xl3-lang** GitHub organization and the
npm package renamed `@jinyoung4478/xl3` → `@xl3-lang/xl3` (install name
only; the old package is deprecated on npm with a pointer to the new
one). Folds in the `@subtotal` correctness fixes #66 (ADR-0073) and
#69 (ADR-0074): a `@subtotal` row carrying a current-row `[Column]`
reference, and group + subtotal under explicit `@block` mode, both used
to fail *silently* with plausible-but-wrong output — each now raises a
dedicated error.

Gate impact:

- **G1** — corpus 157 → 160 fixtures (159 mixed-row error, 160
  formula-cache-is-not-a-marker, 161 explicit-block rejection).
- **G3 / G24** — 2 error codes **added** (`xl3/subtotal/mixed-row`,
  `xl3/subtotal/explicit-block-unsupported`); none renamed, removed, or
  repurposed. Additive per the breaking-change definition above, so the
  quarter clock does **not** reset.
- **G6** — public API surface snapshot unchanged. The rename affects the
  install name only: `convert` / `preview` / `analyze`, the subpath
  exports, and the `xl3-conformance` bin are identical.

### 0.11.0 — JSON source input (shipped 2026-07-19)

`convertJson` / `previewJson` accept the language-neutral
`xl3-source-json/0.1` wire format in place of a `data.xlsx`, so
non-Excel hosts (Python, DB/ETL services) skip the workbook round-trip
(ADR-0075, #71, implemented in #80). The JS reference impl also moved to
`impl/js/` under a root npm workspace (#79) — layout only, no behavior
change.

Gate impact:

- **G3 / G24** — 1 error code **added** (`xl3/source-json/invalid`);
  additive, clock not reset.
- **G6** — the frozen surface gains two exports (`convertJson`,
  `previewJson`, recorded in `spec/STABILITY.md`). Additive: no existing
  export removed or re-signed, and the `.xlsx` path is untouched.
- **G24 window (historical calculation)** — both cuts landed 2026-07-19
  without a breaking change. ADR-0079 later rebased G24 to 2026-08-16,
  when the final blocking implementation gate actually closed; the old
  2026-06-23 / 2026-09-21 calculation is superseded.
- **Resolved by the 2026-07-28 audit (#86)** — the conclusion above is
  correct, but it rested on a definition that did not say so. `Breaking
  change` clause (a) read "any change to public API surface snapshot",
  which made `convertJson` breaking while an added error code was not.
  Clause (a) is now scoped to removal / rename / re-signature, matching
  (b), and G3/G6 carry an explicit "additions allowed" criterion. G3 and
  G6 therefore held through this cut and the quarter was never reset.

### 0.12.0 — CLI + byte-reproducible output (shipped 2026-08-02)

An `xl3` bin so any language can render a template: it takes
`xl3-source-json/0.1` on stdin and writes `.xlsx` files, which closes the
gap ADR-0075 opened but could not reach — a JVM or Python service no
longer needs a JS runtime, or a throwaway `data.xlsx`, to render. Render
output is also byte-reproducible now: zip entry mod-times were stamped
from the clock, so identical inputs produced different bytes whenever two
renders crossed a DOS-timestamp tick.

Gate impact:

- **G3** — no error code added, renamed, or repurposed. The CLI reports
  existing codes; it does not raise its own.
- **G6** — public API surface snapshot unchanged. The bin is a package
  entry point, not an export, and `ZIP_ENTRY_DATE` stays internal to
  `excel-document.ts`.
- **G8 / G9** — the determinism fix adds a zip header rewrite: 2 ms at
  10k cells, 7 ms at 500k. `bench` moved 220 → 229 ms on wide-flat and
  not at all on the other two scenarios, so `scripts/BENCH.md` stands
  and the ratio-based perf guards are unaffected.
- **G24 window** — output *bytes* changed for identical inputs while
  workbook *content* did not. Not breaking under the definition above,
  which scopes clause (a) to removal / rename / re-signature of the API
  surface and clause (b) to spec and error-code semantics. The spec's
  output contract is content-level — Stage 1 compares cell values,
  Stage 2 compares canonicalized parts, and neither reads zip mtimes —
  so the corpus is unaffected (169/169 at Stage 2, all three timezones)
  and the quarter is undisturbed. Worth stating explicitly because a
  changed output byte *looks* like the kind of thing that resets the
  clock: what the spec promises is the workbook, not the packaging.

  The one consumer-visible consequence: a golden-file test baselined on
  0.11.0 bytes needs re-baselining. Documented in CHANGELOG under Fixed.

### 0.13.0 — Runtime engine identity (shipped 2026-08-12)

`VERSION` and `getEngineInfo()` (#103). A host fielding "this conversion
looks wrong" is always asked which xl3 produced it, and there was no way
to answer from inside the process: the main entry exported no version,
`version.ts` holds semver *helpers* only, and `exports` did not expose
`./package.json` — so the remaining route was reading
`node_modules/@xl3-lang/xl3/package.json` off disk and injecting it at
build time. `getEngineInfo()` also answers whether the optional
`xl3-wasm` backend is the one in use, which had no runtime route either.

Gate impact:

- **G3** — no error code added, renamed, or repurposed.
- **G6** — the frozen surface gains two exports (`VERSION`,
  `getEngineInfo`) plus the `EngineInfo` type, recorded in
  `spec/STABILITY.md`: 15 → 17. Additive, so the gate stands. Nothing
  existing was removed or re-signed.
- **G8 / G9** — render path untouched. `VERSION` is a compile-time
  constant and `getEngineInfo()` is never called during a conversion;
  `bench` sat at 240 / 71 / 71 ms, inside the <10% run-to-run band
  `scripts/BENCH.md` documents.
- **G24 window** — additive under the breaking-change definition above.
  ADR-0079 later starts the technical window on 2026-08-16, when G5 closed;
  this release does not move that date.

One correction landed with this cut: the `spec/STABILITY.md` additive log
carried `ConvertOptions.signal` and `xl3/abort/cancelled` as
`unreleased`, but both shipped in 0.12.0 — `impl/js/src/abort.ts` and the
catalog entry are present at tag `v0.12.0`. The rows now say so. The
0.12.0 CHANGELOG section still has no entry for the G21 abort work
itself; that section is published history and is left as-is rather than
backfilled.

### 1.0.0 — Final cut

Gate closed: **G24** (the 90-day technical stability window completes),
all repository release gates are green, and no known critical data-loss or
security issue remains. G13/G14/G15/G18 continue on the 1.x adoption track.
The frozen product claim is the in-memory JavaScript data → Excel template →
`.xlsx` export workflow above, not JXLS feature parity.

## Recruitment and outreach

Adoption-track outcomes (G13/G14/G15/G18) require people, not code. The
project has two distinct recruitment surfaces:

### Korean operations audience (G15, future cookbook contributors)

Channels: Korean developer communities (Naver Café, Kakao 오픈톡,
LinkedIn KR), internal company / vendor template-author surveys.
Each minor release publishes a Korean-language post tied to the
release moment (0.6 = `@group`/`@subtotal` demo for invoice
subtotal patterns; 0.7 = perf numbers; 0.8 = case study).

### English OSS audience (G13, G14)

Channels: HN, lobste.rs, r/excel, conference CFPs (JSConf, EuroPython
for xl3-py). Each major moment ships with one specific external
artifact:

- 0.7.0 release: "Show HN: xl3 0.7 — 100k-row Excel template engine"
- 0.8.0 release: case study + xl3-py conformance dashboard
- 1.0.0 release: stable technical contract + current port status, without
  claiming multi-implementation maturity unless G13 has actually closed

## Non-goals for 1.0

These are intentionally deferred. Each has an ADR explaining why:

- **Date arithmetic beyond Y/M/D/EOMONTH/EDATE/DATEDIF** — the rest of
  the family deferred per [ADR-0019 amendment](./spec/decisions/0019-deferred-date-arithmetic.md).
- **Locale-aware string collation** —
  [ADR-0020](./spec/decisions/0020-deferred-locale-collation.md).
- **Multi-join, left-join, multi-row matches** —
  [ADR-0014](./spec/decisions/0014-source-joins.md) out-of-scope section.
- **XLOOKUP wildcard / approximate / reverse search** —
  [ADR-0013](./spec/decisions/0013-xlookup-cross-source-lookup.md)
  out-of-scope section.
- **Dynamic image insertion** — [ADR-0037](./spec/decisions/0037-rejected-dynamic-image-insertion.md).
- **Runtime cell mutation** — [ADR-0042](./spec/decisions/0042-rejected-runtime-cell-mutation.md).
- **Functions rejected per ADR-0043 gate** — math expansion, type
  tests (except `ISBLANK` per ADR-0047), NOW / WEEKDAY etc., conditional
  aggregates, TEXT() format-token expansion. See
  [ADR-0045](./spec/decisions/0045-function-batch-rejected.md).
- **Streaming output / SXSSF analog.** Deferred to 1.1+. **At 1.0,
  hard memory/row limits are documented (G21) instead.**
- **Template compile caching API.** Deferred to 1.1+.
- **PDF / HTML output.** Out of scope; xl3 is xlsx-in, xlsx-out.
- **Cross-writer Stage 2 fixtures beyond `093`** —
  [ADR-0006](./spec/decisions/0006-stage-2-ooxml-conformance.md) amendment.
- **Output-side template schema (`produces`) and design-time chaining** —
  the input-validation proposal in xl3#109 (`validateSource()`: "does
  this source satisfy this template?", reusing the existing
  `xl3/source/*` codes) is scoped to the **input side first**. Its output
  counterpart — `TemplateModel.produces` carrying output column labels,
  which is what would let a host verify a `templateA → templateB` edge
  without running a conversion — is deferred. It needs a convention the
  project has not fixed: *which* literal row of a sheet template is the
  output header. Unlike `requires`, that is not derivable from what the
  parser resolved, so it has to be decided and written down rather than
  inferred independently by each engine. No ADR yet; the design
  discussion is in xl3#109.

These remain candidates for **XTL 1.1, 1.2, 1.x** based on demand.

## How to help advance the adoption track

| Item | How to help |
|---|---|
| G13 second-impl ≥ 80% | Contribute to [xl3-py](https://github.com/xl3-lang/xl3-py), or start a new port (Rust, Java, Go). See [PORTERS_GUIDE.md](./PORTERS_GUIDE.md). |
| G14 external ADR | Pick a deferred item (pivot table preservation, page-break, ADR-0045 carved-out function), draft an ADR in `spec/decisions/`. See [GOVERNANCE.md](./GOVERNANCE.md) "How changes enter the project." A few "starter ADR stubs" are available as `good-first-ADR` issues on GitHub. |
| G15 production case | Use xl3 internally, share what worked / didn't. Drop a row in [IMPLEMENTATIONS.md](./IMPLEMENTATIONS.md) if appropriate. The maintainer's own employer (Snack24h) qualifies if it ships a public case study. |
| Function re-proposal | If you need a function rejected per ADR-0045, file the [`Function re-proposal`](https://github.com/xl3-lang/xl3/issues/new?template=function-reproposal.md) issue template. |

## How this roadmap evolves

This document is the public elevator pitch; the blocking table and adoption
track are the single source of truth. The deeper
[`docs/internal/blueprint-to-1.0.md`](./docs/internal/blueprint-to-1.0.md)
carries the gap analysis, philosophy boundary, and per-version
rationale. As gates tick, both documents update. As new gaps surface,
both add them.

Cuts, additions, or movements between the blocking table and adoption track
are discussed via the same ADR/issue process as everything else.

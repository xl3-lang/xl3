# Roadmap

What needs to happen for **XTL 1.0** (spec) and **xl3 1.0** (reference
implementation).

The current version is **0.8.0** (npm) targeting **XTL 0.1 (draft)**.
Breaking changes are still possible during 0.x. The 1.0 cut is gated on
the items below, not on a calendar date.

## What 1.0 means for xl3

The 1.0 target is **operator-readable trust**: a spec that doesn't
shift, a reference impl that doesn't surprise, and a surface small
enough that an operator can review a template without reading code.
It is **not** about feature completeness vs JXLS — xl3 intentionally
ships a smaller surface (ADR-0043 + ADR-0048). The intended audience
is **Korean operations teams that manage many customer-specific
invoice formats** (거래명세서, 정산서, 발주서); the engine
generalizes beyond this niche, but the niche is the wedge.

## 1.0 gate table (single source of truth)

Each gate has an owner, the artifact that closes it, the pass-fail
criterion, a fallback if the gate is unreachable, and the target
milestone. Per-version step plan below references these gates by ID.

| ID | Gate | Owner | Artifact | Pass criterion | Fallback | Target |
|----|------|-------|----------|----------------|----------|--------|
| G1 | Conformance corpus ≥ 140 | maintainer | `conformance/fixtures/` | `ls conformance/fixtures/ \| wc -l` ≥ 140 | — | DONE (156 fixtures; ADR-0066 added 141-145 mid-0.7.x; ADRs 0067-0069 added 146-155 in 0.8.0; 156 (#49 native value preservation) + 157 (#51 grouped side cells) added post-0.8.1; ADRs 0051-0065 reserved further numbers for 0.7.1) |

| G12 | Undecided behavior pinned (pivot/sparkline/ListObject/page break) | maintainer | conformance fixtures + ADR per item | each: fixture pinning current behavior OR ADR explicitly deferring to 1.x | defer to 1.1 with ADR | 0.7.1 / 0.8 |
| G13 | Second-language impl validation | external (xl3-py) | `conformance/reports/*.json` | xl3-py passes ≥ 80% Stage 1 OR ≥ 80% Stage 2, OR documented 50% skeleton in another language (Rust/Go/Java) within 12 months of all other gates closing | accept single-impl 1.0 via public ADR amending GOVERNANCE | 0.7.x–0.8.x |

| G24 | "Stable quarter" post-checklist | maintainer | release calendar | 90-day window after the FINAL gate above ticks ✅; no breaking spec/API/error-code change during the window | breaking change → restart clock | between final-gate-tick and 1.0 cut |

### Definitions (testable)

- **External contributor (G14):** not in `GOVERNANCE.md` maintainer set
  AND not in `Co-authored-by` history of merged ADR commits at PR open
  time. Drive-by typo edits do not count; named Author in ADR
  front-matter; authored ≥ 60% of Context/Decision sections by line
  count.
- **Breaking change (G24, G23):** any change to (a) public API
  surface snapshot, (b) error code catalog (rename/removal/repurpose),
  (c) ADR `accepted` → `rejected` or contradicting status flip.
  Patch releases and additive ADRs do NOT reset the quarter clock.
- **Critical bug fix (G23 RC exception):** (a) silent data loss in
  `convert()`, (b) error code catalog inconsistency between docs and
  runtime, OR (c) an `accepted` ADR's MUST that cannot be implemented
  as written. Maintainer cites which of (a)/(b)/(c) in the PR.
- **Data-loss test (G24 testable form):** corpus has a dedicated
  `data-loss/` fixture group (≥ 8 fixtures) exercising silent-
  stringify, numFmt drop, formula rewrite, and date round-trip paths;
  all pass on the reference impl.
- **Quarter clock start (G24 vs G23):** the 90-day quarter starts on
  the day the LAST gate ticks ✅. RC publication does NOT start the
  clock; the clock must have started BEFORE RC publication. If a
  breaking change happens during RC soak, both the soak (G23) and the
  quarter (G24) reset.

## Per-version step plan

Gate-based, not date-based. Calendar estimates have been removed —
each milestone closes when its listed gates close.

### 0.6.0 — Deferred-impl, narrow scope

Theme: close the highest-impact deferred-impl gate cleanly.

Gates closed: **G5** (`@group`/`@subtotal` impl only — the rest of
ADR-0040 PE moves to 0.6.1), **G17** (Korean cookbook 16/17 missing
translations), **G22** (API surface cleanup before @group exposes
new internal types).

The previous "single 0.6.0 with everything" plan was scoped too
ambitiously per the engineering-feasibility review. ADR-0038 impl
alone is a full pipeline insertion (new directive, group-boundary
state machine, transform-pass partition, renderer rewrite,
group-scoped aggregate eval). Splitting 0.6.0 keeps the milestone
shippable.

### 0.6.1 — Rest of deferred-impl (planned, not yet shipped)

Gates closed: **G5** completion (ADR-0040 PE: CF/DV `sqref`
extension), pivot/page-break behavior fixtures toward **G12**.

Status as of 0.7.0 shipping: this milestone was bypassed by the
spec-audit batch (0.7.0). G5/G12 work folded into 0.7.1.

### 0.7.0 — Spec-audit batch (shipped 2026-05-22)

Theme: close 17 syntactic-conflict gaps surfaced by a deep audit
of the lexer, cell classification, directive composition,
aggregate args, and reserved-sheet semantics. Unplanned in the
original gate table; the perf/CI/limits work originally tagged
0.7.0 moves to **0.7.1**.

Shipped artifacts:

- 15 new ADRs (0051–0065) + amendments to ADR-0021 (group-order
  catalog entry) and ADR-0041 (header-cell multi-line
  normalization).
- 4 new error codes — `xl3/parser/unbalanced-literal`,
  `xl3/lists/invalid-use`, `xl3/eval/bad-aggregate-arg`,
  `xl3/expression/unknown-name`.
- Grammar additions: `positive_integer`, `group_directive`,
  `subtotal_directive`, `aggregate_call`, lexical-disambiguation
  note.
- `src/directive-parser.ts` strictness for leading-zero integers.
- Two-pass parallel review (claude-general + codex); all
  CRITICAL/HIGH findings closed before tag.

Gate impact:

- **G1** — 139 fixtures today. The 0.7.0 ADRs reserved fixture
  numbers **141–187**; impl is pending. G1 closes when those
  fixtures land in 0.7.1.
- **G3** — 30-day error-code-catalog clock **reset** on 2026-05-22
  by the 4 new codes.
- **G6** — no public API surface change; G6 clock unaffected.

### 0.7.1 — Performance + external validation begins (relabeled from old 0.7.0)

Gates closed: **G5** completion (ADR-0040 CF/DV `sqref` range),
**G8** (perf benchmarks), **G9** (perf regression fixtures),
**G10** (cross-browser), **G11** (Stage 2 in CI), **G20**
(SECURITY.md draft + threat model), **G21** (hard limits +
AbortSignal docs).

Also closes the **G1 ≥ 140 fixtures** floor by landing fixtures
141–187 reserved by the 0.7.0 ADRs.

Progress toward: **G12** (undecided behavior pinning), **G13**
(xl3-py).

Relabel: `alpha` → `beta` after G8 publishes and xl3-py reaches
≥ 50% Stage 1.

### 0.8.0 — Data-block design overhaul (shipped 2026-05-23)

Theme: unplanned in the original gate table. A late-0.7.x audit of
data-block expansion surfaced two structural bugs (#46 duplicate
shared-formula owners, #47 stale references in displaced side
cells) that needed a column-scoped rewrite before further
feature work. The original "0.8.0 = sociological gates" plan
moved to **0.8.x patches**.

Shipped artifacts:

- **ADR-0066** — data block is now column-scoped: bounding box of
  `{{...}}` markers extended through contiguous non-empty cells.
  Cells outside that range keep their row positions when the block
  expands. Closes #46 / #47 by construction.
- **ADR-0067** — explicit `@block` directive in three forms (bare,
  `A:D` column range, `A2:D7` rectangle).
- **ADR-0068** — strict multi-block detection on opt-in sheets:
  every `[Column]` marker must sit inside some block; block
  rectangles cannot overlap.
- **ADR-0069** — per-block directive scoping by proximity:
  `@filter`/`@sort`/`@top`/`@source`/`@join`/`@group`/`@repeat`
  attach to the closest data block whose column range overlaps the
  directive's column.
- 4 new error codes: `xl3/expression/bracket-outside-block`,
  `xl3/block/overlap`, `xl3/block/empty-table`,
  `xl3/directive/orphan`.
- Conformance fixtures 146-155 (multi-block, side-by-side blocks
  with different sources, vertically stacked blocks, per-block
  filter, per-block `ROW()` scoping, the three new error paths).

Gate impact:

- **G1** — corpus 139 → 154 fixtures. Floor cleared again.
- **G3** — 30-day error-code-catalog clock **reset 2026-05-23** by
  the 4 new codes. Earliest tick: 2026-06-22, contingent on no
  further code additions/renames during 0.8.x patches.

### 0.8.x — Sociological gates (in flight)

Gates closed: **G14** (external ADR), **G15** (production case;
in progress via maintainer's-employer deployment), **G16**
(maintainer widening or explicit single-maintainer acceptance),
**G19** (migration guide), **G20** completion.

The plan is to ship 0.8.x patches during the recruitment period
rather than wait silently. **G3 quarter discipline:** while
sociological gates run, error code additions and renames are
deferred — any addition resets the G3 clock and pushes the 0.9-rc
target. Only critical-bug-fix codes (per the definition in this
file) may be added during the 0.8.x window.

### 0.9.0-rc.x — Pre-1.0 freeze

Gates closed: **G3**, **G6**, **G7**, **G23** (≥ 21-day RC soak).

After G23 starts, the quarter clock for G24 begins (it must have
ticked while G3/G6/G7/etc. were closing — see definitions above).

### 1.0.0 — Final cut

Gate closed: **G24** (90-day quarter complete after last gate
ticked).

## Recruitment and outreach

Sociological gates (G13/G14/G15/G16) require people, not code. The
project has two distinct recruitment surfaces:

### Korean operations audience (G15, future cookbook contributors)

Channels: Korean developer communities (Naver Café, Kakao 오픈톡,
LinkedIn KR), internal company / vendor template-author surveys.
Each minor release publishes a Korean-language post tied to the
release moment (0.6 = `@group`/`@subtotal` demo for invoice
subtotal patterns; 0.7 = perf numbers; 0.8 = case study).

### English OSS audience (G13, G14)

Channels: HN, lobste.rs, r/excel, conference CFPs (JSConf, EuroPython
for xl3-py). Each major moment ships with one specific external
artifact:

- 0.7.0 release: "Show HN: xl3 0.7 — 100k-row Excel template engine"
- 0.8.0 release: case study + xl3-py conformance dashboard
- 1.0.0 release: spec + multi-impl validation

## Non-goals for 1.0

These are intentionally deferred. Each has an ADR explaining why:

- **Date arithmetic beyond Y/M/D/EOMONTH/EDATE/DATEDIF** — the rest of
  the family deferred per [ADR-0019 amendment](./spec/decisions/0019-deferred-date-arithmetic.md).
- **Locale-aware string collation** —
  [ADR-0020](./spec/decisions/0020-deferred-locale-collation.md).
- **Multi-join, left-join, multi-row matches** —
  [ADR-0014](./spec/decisions/0014-source-joins.md) out-of-scope section.
- **XLOOKUP wildcard / approximate / reverse search** —
  [ADR-0013](./spec/decisions/0013-xlookup-cross-source-lookup.md)
  out-of-scope section.
- **Dynamic image insertion** — [ADR-0037](./spec/decisions/0037-rejected-dynamic-image-insertion.md).
- **Runtime cell mutation** — [ADR-0042](./spec/decisions/0042-rejected-runtime-cell-mutation.md).
- **Functions rejected per ADR-0043 gate** — math expansion, type
  tests (except `ISBLANK` per ADR-0047), NOW / WEEKDAY etc., conditional
  aggregates, TEXT() format-token expansion. See
  [ADR-0045](./spec/decisions/0045-function-batch-rejected.md).
- **Streaming output / SXSSF analog.** Deferred to 1.1+. **At 1.0,
  hard memory/row limits are documented (G21) instead.**
- **Template compile caching API.** Deferred to 1.1+.
- **PDF / HTML output.** Out of scope; xl3 is xlsx-in, xlsx-out.
- **Cross-writer Stage 2 fixtures beyond `093`** —
  [ADR-0006](./spec/decisions/0006-stage-2-ooxml-conformance.md) amendment.

These remain candidates for **XTL 1.1, 1.2, 1.x** based on demand.

## How to help close items

| Item | How to help |
|---|---|
| G13 second-impl ≥ 80% | Contribute to [xl3-py](https://github.com/jinyoung4478/xl3-py), or start a new port (Rust, Java, Go). See [PORTERS_GUIDE.md](./PORTERS_GUIDE.md). |
| G14 external ADR | Pick a deferred item (pivot table preservation, page-break, ADR-0045 carved-out function), draft an ADR in `spec/decisions/`. See [GOVERNANCE.md](./GOVERNANCE.md) "How changes enter the project." A few "starter ADR stubs" are available as `good-first-ADR` issues on GitHub. |
| G15 production case | Use xl3 internally, share what worked / didn't. Drop a row in [IMPLEMENTATIONS.md](./IMPLEMENTATIONS.md) if appropriate. The maintainer's own employer (Snack24h) qualifies if it ships a public case study. |
| G17 Korean cookbook 16+17 i18n | Translate the two newest recipes (the rest are done). |
| G8 benchmarks | Run `npm run bench` on representative templates, share results. |
| G10 cross-browser | Add Safari + Firefox to the bundle smoke test. |
| Function re-proposal | If you need a function rejected per ADR-0045, file the [`Function re-proposal`](https://github.com/jinyoung4478/xl3/issues/new?template=function-reproposal.md) issue template. |

## How this roadmap evolves

This document is the public elevator pitch + the gate table is the
single source of truth. The deeper
[`docs/internal/blueprint-to-1.0.md`](./docs/internal/blueprint-to-1.0.md)
carries the gap analysis, philosophy boundary, and per-version
rationale. As gates tick, both documents update. As new gaps surface,
both add them.

Cuts and additions to the 1.0 gate table are discussed via the same
ADR/issue process as everything else.

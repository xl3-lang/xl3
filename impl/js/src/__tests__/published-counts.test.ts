// Six surfaces state the corpus size and the ADR count as prose: the
// homepage Standard section, the JSON-LD featureList in the site config,
// `site/llms-full.txt`, and the four READMEs. Nothing generates any of
// them, and they drifted — the homepage still said 75 ADRs / 160 fixtures
// while the corpus was at 77 / 169, and an external reviewer quoted the
// stale pair back at the project as fact. This test turns a stale claim
// into a red test instead of a marketing bug.
//
// A *reworded* claim fails too, on purpose. If a regex stops matching,
// that number is no longer being checked at all, and silently passing is
// worse than a failure that names the file and the sentence. When a
// sentence legitimately changes, update its pattern here.
//
// Not covered on purpose: ROADMAP.md, CHANGELOG.md, and the conformance
// reports. Those record what was true at a past moment — a gate note
// saying "DONE (160 fixtures)" is history, not a claim about today.
//
// The same split applies to the *version* claims checked at the bottom of
// this file. "shipped in 0.12.0" and the `### 0.12.0` release sections are
// history and stay put; "The current version is 0.12.0" is a claim about
// today and goes stale the moment a release lands. Two of those survived
// the 0.13.0 cut — the release updated the four READMEs and the CDN pins
// but not these, and RELEASING's post-publish check greps for
// `@xl3-lang/xl3@N` pins, which is a shape neither of them has.

// This test file lives at impl/js/src/__tests__/; the repo root
// (spec/, conformance/, README.md, …) is four levels up.

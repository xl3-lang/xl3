## How to add a port

1. Make your port emit a JSON report in the format documented in [`conformance/runner-protocol.md`](./runner-protocol.md) "JSON report format".
2. Save it under `conformance/reports/<impl>-<version>.json`.
3. Run `node conformance/scripts/dashboard.mjs` from the repo root to regenerate this file.

# What xl3 preserves — and what it doesn't

One question decides whether xl3 fits your template: **does the workbook
come out the other side intact?** This page answers it feature by
feature.

Everything below is a spec decision, not a quirk of one implementation.
The rows marked *deferred* are deferred on purpose, with an ADR saying
so — that is different from "nobody checked."

## The four verdicts

| Verdict | What it means |
|---|---|
| **Preserved** | Comes out identical to the template. Every conforming implementation must do this. |
| **Preserved and extended** | The rule survives and a range fully contained in an `@repeat` block grows with the emitted rows. Partial overlaps are left unchanged so the engine never guesses beyond the authored block. |
| **Preserved, range not extended** | The feature survives, but its range keeps the coordinates the template gave it. If `@repeat` grows the sheet from 1 row to 50, the range still covers the 1 row. There is an author-side fix for each — see the notes. |
| **Deferred** | XTL 0.1 asserts nothing. It may survive, it may be dropped, and two conforming implementations may disagree. Don't build on it before 1.1. |

## Layout and formatting

| Feature | Verdict | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Cell style — font, fill, border, alignment | **Preserved** | |
| Number and date formats | **Preserved** | Also inherited by every `@repeat`-expanded row, not just the first — see [Formatting inside a repeat block](#formatting-inside-a-repeat-block). |
| Row height, column width | **Preserved** | |
| Merged cells | **Preserved** | In the template and in source data rows (ADR-0033, ADR-0035). |
| Images and their anchors | **Preserved** | The anchor does **not** shift when `@repeat` inserts rows above it. Put images in a header, footer, or sidebar — outside the block. |
| Freeze panes and splits | **Preserved** | |
| Cell comments (notes) | **Preserved** | A comment on a `{{ [Column] }}` cell survives onto the rendered cell. |
| Sheet protection, per-cell lock/hidden flags | **Preserved** | Engine-written cells inherit the template cell's lock state rather than a synthesized default. |
| Workbook properties — theme, document properties | **Preserved** | Fixture `120-workbook-properties-preserved`. |
| Native Excel formulas in static cells | **Preserved** | A formula xl3 didn't generate is carried through untouched (ADR-0046). Use this for anything Excel can compute at open time — see [Cookbook 16](./guides/16-xtl-vs-excel-formula.md). |

## Rules with ranges

Range-bearing features follow one of two contracts. Conditional formatting
and data validation grow only when their authored range is fully contained in
an `@repeat` block. A partial overlap is left untouched, so a rule cannot bleed
into a footer the author meant to exclude. Named ranges and print settings are
preserved without coordinate changes.

| Feature | Verdict | Author-side fix |
|---|---|---|
| Conditional formatting | **Preserved and extended** | A rule on `A2:A2` inside a 1-row block expands to `A2:A4` when the block emits 3 rows. Whole-column ranges already cover the output and remain unchanged; partial overlaps are preserved as authored. |
| Data validation (dropdowns, constraints) | **Preserved and extended** | Validation on a cell inside the repeated template rows is copied to the corresponding emitted rows. Validation outside the block is untouched. |
| Named ranges / defined names | **Preserved, range not extended** | Workbook-scope and sheet-scope both survive; references into a repeat-expanded area are not re-pointed. |
| Print area, print titles | **Preserved, range not extended** | Set the print area to a full column span (`$A:$Z`) or repeating header rows (`$1:$1`). |

## Deferred to 1.1

Four features are deliberately left implementation-defined for 1.0
(ADR-0076). The reference implementation's current behavior is recorded
below so you can plan around it, but **none of it is a promise** — that
is what deferred means.

| Feature | Reference implementation today |
|---|---|
| Pivot tables | Not carried through. Cannot be authored or preserved. |
| Sparklines | Not carried through. |
| Structured tables (ListObject) | The table part **survives**, but its `ref` is not extended: a table authored over a `@repeat` row still covers only the rows it originally spanned. Widen the `ref` to a whole column in the template. |
| Page breaks | **Dropped.** Despite sitting next to "print area" conceptually, page breaks are not covered by it. Set them host-side after conversion. |
| Charts | Implementation-defined (ADR-0036 item 3). The reference implementation reads and writes through ExcelJS, whose chart support is incomplete — do not rely on charts surviving. |

## Removed on purpose

| Feature | Behavior |
|---|---|
| Macros (VBA, XLM) | **Stripped, always.** An `.xlsm` input is accepted as XLSX-with-macros-removed and a warning is emitted. Macros never execute, and no host or template can opt back in during 1.x. See [SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md). |

## Formatting inside a repeat block

Range rules and per-cell formatting grow under different contracts, and the
difference is worth knowing. Conditional formatting and data validation fully
contained in the repeated block extend with it; named ranges and print settings
do not. Independently, all emitted rows carry the template cell's number format
and style — not only the first row.

That last guarantee matters more than it sounds. Losing the format on rows
2..N is silent data loss: a column whose first row reads `1,234.50` and
whose remainder reads `1234.5` looks like a styling slip and is
indistinguishable from one. Nine fixtures tagged `data-loss` exist to
keep that from regressing.

## Size limits

| Limit | Value |
|---|---|
| Memory | **~2.2 KB per output cell** at scale, on a ~130 MB floor. 2M cells needs roughly 4.2 GB peak RSS. |
| Cells per conversion | ~2,000,000 verified end to end; ~500,000 fits in a 2 GB host. Size the host at 2.2 KB/cell before assuming a bigger job runs. |
| Cell string length | xl3 writes what you give it. Excel rejects cells over 32,767 characters on read, and xl3 does **not** pre-validate — check length upstream if the output must open in Excel (ADR-0032). |

Exceeding available memory surfaces as a host-level out-of-memory, not
as an xl3 error — xl3 cannot catch it. Long conversions accept an
`AbortSignal`.

## How much of this is machine-checked

Partly, and it is worth knowing which parts.

- `123-feature-preservation` checks named ranges and cell comments
  surviving the render cycle, as a Stage 1 cell-value comparison.
- `170-data-loss-numfmt-preserved-across-expansion` checks, in Stage 2,
  that number formats survive `@repeat` expansion — the trap described
  above.
- `171-cf-dv-range-extension` checks, in Stage 2, that contained
  conditional-formatting and data-validation ranges extend while partial
  overlaps remain unchanged.
- A full Stage 2 canonical comparison of *every* row in the tables above
  is still pending canonicalizer work under ADR-0006.

So the rows without a fixture behind them are spec promises rather than
machine-verified ones. Every implementation runs the same [conformance
corpus](../conformance/README.md), so what is checked is checked
everywhere — but the corpus does not yet cover the whole matrix, and
this page would rather say so than imply otherwise.

## Where these decisions live

This page is a plain-language reading of the normative sources. When
they disagree, they win:

- [`spec/evaluation.md` § Styles and Workbook Structure](../spec/evaluation.md) — the normative rules
- [ADR-0036](../spec/decisions/0036-feature-preservation-matrix.md) — the nine-feature preservation matrix and why each is preserve-verbatim rather than preserve-and-extend
- [ADR-0076](../spec/decisions/0076-pivot-sparkline-listobject-pagebreak-deferred.md) — pivot / sparkline / ListObject / page break deferred to 1.1, with measured behavior
- [ADR-0046](../spec/decisions/0046-cell-formula-preservation.md) — native Excel formulas in static cells
- [ADR-0032](../spec/decisions/0032-niche-limits-and-pass-through.md) — string length and other niche limits
- [ADR-0022](../spec/decisions/0022-excel-version-compatibility.md) — Excel version compatibility
- [SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md) — the macro, network, and filesystem stance
